\hspace{2.5cm} The four essential freedoms 
\vspace{0.6cm} A program is free software if the program's users have the 4 essential freedoms: The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).\vspace{0.2cm} The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
\vspace{0.2cm} The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbour (freedom 2).
\vspace{0.2cm} The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
